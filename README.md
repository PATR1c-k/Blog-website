# Blog-website
this is a blog website made with EJS which composes posts within website just by adding "/compose" in the url (eg. localhost:5000/compose).
This is demonstration of my EJS templating skills.

#How to run website locally
1.Firstly this website works on mongodb so you have to create a mongoDB id. extract cluster name and password from that account.
2.Use that credentials in name of {NAME} and {PASSWORD} so that application will be connected to your own mongoDB cluster.
3.Now you are ready to go to setup website on localhost.
